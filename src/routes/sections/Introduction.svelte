	Manifolds are fundamental mathematical objects that have become increasingly important 
	in understanding the structure of high-dimensional data and neural network representations. 
	A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space, providing a 
	powerful framework for understanding complex, nonlinear structures in data

	The study of manifolds in machine learning has revealed that many high-dimensional 
	datasets actually lie on or near low-dimensional manifolds embedded in the ambient space 
	<d-cite key="roweis2000nonlinear"></d-cite>. This insight has led to the development of 
	manifold learning algorithms that can discover these underlying structures and perform 
	dimensionality reduction while preserving the essential geometric properties of the data

	In the context of artificial intelligence, manifolds provide a geometric perspective on 
	how neural networks organize and represent information. Recent work has shown that the 
	activations of deep neural networks often lie on smooth manifolds, and understanding 
	these geometric structures is crucial for interpretability and robustness
